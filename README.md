MA full text draft v3.2.Rmd is an R Markdown file that will compile into MA full text draft v3.2.pdf, using bibliography MAbib.bib. This produces the version of the thesis
that I defended to get my Master's.

The R Markdown file pulls data from the Data folder. Before running, unzip Apr2020revdata.zip, which contains a csv data file that was too large for upload,
and move the contents to the Data folder.

The Final Formatted Version folder contains the version of the Master's that is formatted according to UNC University guidelines. 
This version cosmetically edited the figures for compliance with Grad School formatting requirements, but is otherwise unchanged.
